I was responsible for the frontend development of our group project - an inventory system. I first used Adobe Illustrator to create the initial layout and graphic design. 
After reviewing the design, I wrote the HTML layer and the CSS code for the layout. After the CSS and HTML files were sent to the server, users were able to view and use the
website. My work was of critical importance: the website had to not just look pretty, but also work well. It contributed to our efforts in developing a user-friendly inventory 
system.
